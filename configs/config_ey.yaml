  system_prompt: |
    You are an expert financial analyst skilled in generating questions that are meaningful for financial analysis or generating insights from the
    company financial reports. Your task involves analyzing a webpage/pdf that includes at least one table to generate interesting reasoning questions.
    While performing this task, you must adhere to a set of specified constraints.

  q_generation: |
    Given the text of a scraped webpage/pdf, generate 5 financial reasoning questions. Please adhere to the following constraints meticulously when formulating the questions.
    Constraints:
      1. The questions must be generated such that they always leads to a single numerical or boolean answer.
      2. The questions must be strictly derived from the content present in the text.
      3. Answering the questions should require the use of one or more values from the table(s) and/or values present in the text around the table(s).
      4. Calculating the answer should involve multi-hop reasoning with the following arithmetic operations:
        -Basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exponential, Greater Than
        -Table aggregation operations: Sum, Average, Minimum, Maximum

    Return **only** the raw JSON arrayâ€”no markdown code fences, no backticks, no leading or trailing `json` labels:
      [{{
      "Question": "<Generated Question 1>".
      }},
      {{
      "Question:" "<Generated Question 2>".
      }}
      ]

    Text:
    {text}

  # Summary generation prompt
  summary: |
    Summarize this document in 3-5 sentences, focusing on the main topic and key concepts.
  
  # QA pair generation prompt
  qa_generation: |
    Create {num_pairs} question-answer pairs from this text for LLM training.
    
    Rules:
    1. Questions must be about important facts in the text
    2. Answers must be directly supported by the text
    3. Return JSON format only:
    
    [
      {{
        "question": "Question 1?",
        "answer": "Answer 1."
      }},
      {{
        "question": "Question 2?",
        "answer": "Answer 2."
      }}
    ]
    
    Text:
    {text}
  
  # QA pair rating prompt
  qa_rating: |
    Rate each question-answer pair on a scale from 1-10, based on:
    - Accuracy (0-3): factual correctness
    - Relevance (0-2): relevance to content
    - Clarity (0-2): clear language
    - Usefulness (0-3): value for model learning
    
    YOU MUST RETURN A VALID JSON OBJECT OR ARRAY WITH THIS EXACT SCHEMA:
    {{
      "question": "Exact question text",
      "answer": "Exact answer text",
      "rating": 8
    }}
    
    OR FOR MULTIPLE PAIRS:
    [
      {{"question": "Q1", "answer": "A1", "rating": 8}},
      {{"question": "Q2", "answer": "A2", "rating": 9}}
    ]
    
    *** YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE VALID JSON AND NOTHING ELSE - NO EXPLANATION, NO MARKDOWN ***

  # Chain of Thought generation prompt
  cot_generation: |
    Given the text from a scraped financial pdf/webpage, generate 10 financial tabular reasoning questions. Please adhere to the following constraints meticulously when formulating the question.
    Constraints:
      1. The questions must be generated such that they always leads to a single numerical or boolean answer.
      2. The questions must be strictly derived from the content present in the provided text.
      3. Answering the question should require the use of values from the table and/or values present in the text around the table.
      4. Calculating the answer should involve multi-hop reasoning with the following arithmetic operations:
        -Basic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exponential, Greater Than
        -Table aggregation operations: Sum, Average, Minimum, Maximum
    
    Return JSON format only:
    
    [
      {{
        "question": "Complex question about the text?",
        "reasoning": "Step 1: First, I need to consider...\nStep 2: Then, I analyze...\nStep 3: Finally, I can conclude...",
        "answer": "Final mumerical answer based on the reasoning."
      }},
      {{
        "question": "Another complex question?",
        "reasoning": "Step 1: First, I'll analyze...\nStep 2: Next, I need to determine...\nStep 3: Based on this analysis...",

  # Chain of Thought enhancement prompt
  cot_enhancement: |
    You are an expert reasoning assistant. Your task is to enhance the given conversations by adding chain-of-thought reasoning.
    
    For each conversation, add detailed step-by-step reasoning to the assistant's responses while preserving the original answer.
    
    {include_simple_steps} = Whether to add reasoning to simple responses too. If false, only add reasoning to complex responses.
    
    Return the enhanced conversations as a JSON array matching this format:
    [
      [
        {{"role": "system", "content": "System message"}},
        {{"role": "user", "content": "User question"}},
