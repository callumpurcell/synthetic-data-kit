Hence, positive news, such as signing on a major customer or forming a new strategic alliance, can lead to sizable returns before the mainstream investing world even discovers the stock. Conversely, negative news can lead to significant losses.\\nLeverage: Penny stocks attract investors with a small amount of trading capital since their lower share prices allow them to buy thousands of shares. For example, an investor with $500 can buy 2,000 shares of a penny stock trading at 25 cents. If the stock doubles in a month, the investor earns a quick 100% return. Yet, with the same starting capital, the investor can afford only a small number of shares in most S&P 500 stocks, making it almost impossible to achieve those gains over the same period.\\nRisks of Investing in Penny Stocks\\nLow liquidity: Penny stocks often trade on thin volume, meaning it can be difficult to enter and exit positions. Moreover, these stocks typically have a wide spread between the bid and ask, which increases trading costs. For example, if a penny stock has a bid price of $1.00 and an ask price of $1.50, a trader wanting to buy at market gets caught paying a 50 cent per share premium. Thus, investors should use limit orders to minimize trading costs when buying and selling penny stocks.\\nExtreme valuations: Penny stocks that start moving rapidly higher in price show up on stock screeners and may even get media attention. This often attracts more speculators who push prices up even higher, leading to unsustainable valuations. For instance, during the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, many penny technology stocks doubled and tripled in price despite not generating any earnings. However, when the market turned bearish a few years later, many Nasdaq-listed penny stocks with unsustainable valuations fell substantially or were delisted.\\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Those who invest in them should monitor these key trends, as they will likely guide price direction in the months and years ahead.\\nFinancing: Most U.S. financial institutions avoid funding cannabis companies, as marijuana is still federally illegal, meaning lenders that provide loans could face possible prosecution. However, the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act (SAFE)—which passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2021—aimed to address this by preventing the federal government from penalizing banks that offer financial services to the cannabis industry. Although the legislation failed to gain support in the Senate, investors should monitor any future legislation that may have a similar bent.\\nMerger & acquisition: Merger & acquisition (M&A) transactions in the U.S. cannabis industry hit a record $10.3 billion in 2021 before dropping off to about $3 billion in 2022, reflecting the year's suboptimal market conditions. Increased dealmaking in 2023 could indicate that institutional investors have growing confidence in the cannabis industry's future.\\nPotential U.S. legalization: While several cannabis legalization bills are floating around the halls of Congress, bipartisan support remains difficult to achieve, creating a large amount of uncertainty for industry participants.\\nAdvantages of Cannabis Stocks\\nDespite the underwhelming performance of marijuana stocks over the past year, the sector offers risk-taking investors significant growth potential. According to industry analysis firm MJBizDaily, U.S. cannabis sales are projected to surpass $33 billion in 2023 before reaching almost $57 billion by the end of 2028.\\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

Rising sales can help investors identify companies that are able to increase revenue organically or through other means and find growing companies that haven't yet reached profitability. In addition, accounting factors that may not reflect the overall strength of the business can significantly influence earnings per share (EPS). However, sales growth alone doesn't guarantee a strong business because a company must also control costs.\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Fastest-Growing Cannabis Stocks</th>\\n<th></th>\\n<th></th>\\n<th></th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Price ($)</td>\\n<td>Market Cap ($M)</td>\\n<td>Revenue Growth (%)</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>SNDL Inc.

Those who invest in them should monitor these key trends, as they will likely guide price direction in the months and years ahead.\\nFinancing: Most U.S. financial institutions avoid funding cannabis companies, as marijuana is still federally illegal, meaning lenders that provide loans could face possible prosecution. However, the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act (SAFE)—which passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2021—aimed to address this by preventing the federal government from penalizing banks that offer financial services to the cannabis industry. Although the legislation failed to gain support in the Senate, investors should monitor any future legislation that may have a similar bent.\\nMerger & acquisition: Merger & acquisition (M&A) transactions in the U.S. cannabis industry hit a record $10.3 billion in 2021 before dropping off to about $3 billion in 2022, reflecting the year's suboptimal market conditions. Increased dealmaking in 2023 could indicate that institutional investors have growing confidence in the cannabis industry's future.\\nPotential U.S. legalization: While several cannabis legalization bills are floating around the halls of Congress, bipartisan support remains difficult to achieve, creating a large amount of uncertainty for industry participants.\\nAdvantages of Cannabis Stocks\\nDespite the underwhelming performance of marijuana stocks over the past year, the sector offers risk-taking investors significant growth potential. According to industry analysis firm MJBizDaily, U.S. cannabis sales are projected to surpass $33 billion in 2023 before reaching almost $57 billion by the end of 2028.\\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.
